# Music Row 

## Project Description
This was an exercise I started with the basic idea of utilizing factory functions to generate new objects prompted by Nashville Software School Cohort 55 curriculum. The general idea was to get more acquainted and build muscle memory building factory functions to better understand them.

As a stretch goal I took the factory function and populated the DOM as we were doing in class most of the week I took this exercise on. It helped me get a much better understanding of how to use Javascript to build HTML in your index file. 

The lightning exercises were done on a separate javascript file to keep from obstructing the main project.

### The initial prompt from NSS curriculum is below: 

##### Practice: Doctors
###### Lightning Exercise 1: Write a factory function that creates an object that represents a doctor. The function should accept three arguments.

Doctor's name
Specialty (Oncologist, pediatrician, etc...)
Address of practice<br>

###### Lightning Exercise 2: Write a factory function that creates an object that represents a pet. The function should accept two arguments.

Pet name
Pet breed
Invoke the factory function 3 times and place each animal in an array stored in a variable named BowWowKennels

###### Practice: Music Row
Your job is to sign each of these promising young music stars to the appropriate label.

JumpStop Records works with Funk and Rap artists.
Chatten Records works with Country and Bluegrass artists.
Polar Records works with Pop artists.
Create an array for each of these record labels.

Create a factory function for each possible genre (e.g. createBluegrassArtist()). Then invoke the appropriate function for each of the following artists and place the resulting object in the corresponding label array.

Bruce Atikins is a Country artist and is 23 years old
Jensen Brown is a Pop artist and is 20 years old
Dre Funkz is a Funk artist and is 25 years old
Dusta Grimes is a Rap artist and is 21 years old
